This is tcl interface to link grammar parser (using C-Api) from
http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/
Davy Temperley    Daniel Sleator    John Lafferty

in directory unix there is directly all code from link-parser in version 4.1b
All source of link parser are copied to subdirectory unix
Because of some technical reasons all files form original "src" and "include"
subdirectories are copied to main directory.
So the original "Makefile" in unix directory will not work.
I have to adapt the file read_dict.c and make funkction "advance" static
because of the same function in glibc library.

This library was build for needs of the project Esperantilo
http://www.esperantilo.org

WARNING
This library do not garant access to all functions of link parser


USAGE

linkparser::init

linkparser::parser sentence

linkpareser:close

Warning: ensure that the directory "data", which is in unix directory are in current
path when you load a direcotory per linkparser::init

Example:

linkparser::init
linkparser::parser "The parser works well"
linkpareser:close

The output of ::parser is a list
- first element are a list of tokens with "walls"
- second element are a list of tokens with "walls" with tagging information
- 3 to end elements are links
- The link are list of 3 element: {index-to-left-token label index-to-right-token}

Exampe for "The parser works well"
{LEFT-WALL the parser works well RIGHT-WALL} {LEFT-WALL the parser.n works.v well.e RIGHT-WALL} {0 RW 5} {0 Wd 2} {1 Ds 2} {2 Ss 3} {3 MVa 4}

See original documentation of link parser and source code.

COMPILING

./configure --with-tcl=path_to_dir_with_tcl --prefix=your_prefix
make

INSTALLING

make install

(Warning: The directory "data" are not installed property.
So you need do it yourself by your program)
