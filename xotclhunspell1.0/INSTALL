Source code for
Tcl
XOTcl
Hunspell

Information

The configure script use Tcl TEA (adapted for Tcl) Architecture
for configuring.
But it has small hack to adapt it for C++.
So I think it will not work for non gcc compilers (so hack your own Makefile.in)
See comented palces in Makefile.in

Compiling for Linux

./configure
#See configure --help to get all needed options
# but you need options
# --with-tcl=?
# --with-xotcl=?
# --with-hunspell=?
# --prefix=?
./make
./make install

Compiling for Windows

See file
Makefile.win

You need some adaptation and other resources to compile it
see coments in that file
You need C++ compiler (There is free VC++ from MS)
